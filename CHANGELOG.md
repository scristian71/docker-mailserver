1. This release fixes a critical issue for LDAP users, installing a needed package on Debian 11
   on build-time. Moreover, a race-condition was eliminated ([#2341](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2341)).
2. A resource leak in `check-for-changes.sh` was fixed ([#2401](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2401))

### Other Minor Changes

1. `SPAMASSASSIN_SPAM_TO_INBOX`'s default changed to `1`. ([#2361](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2361))
2. Changedetector functionality was added to `SSL_TYPE=manual`-setups. ([#2404](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2404))
3. Four new environment variables were introduced: `LOGWATCH_SENDER`, `ENABLE_DNSBL`, `DOVECOT_INET_PROTOCOLS` and `ENABLE_SPAMASSASSIN_KAM`. ([#2362](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2362), [#2342](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2342), [#2358](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2358), [#2418](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2418))

## `v10.4.0`

This release upgrades our base image from Debian 10 to Debian 11.  
There is also an important regression fixed for `SSL_TYPE=letsencrypt` users.

- **[fix]** A regression with `check-for-changes.sh` introduced in `v10.3.0` affected `SSL_TYPE=letsencrypt`, preventing detection of cert renewals to restart services (_unless using `acme.json`_) [#2326](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2326)
- **[improvement]** Base image upgraded from Debian 10 Buster to Debian 11 Bullseye [#2116](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2116)
  - Postfix upgraded from `3.4` to `3.5`. Dovecot upgraded from `2.3.4` to `2.3.13`. Python 2 is no longer included in the image, Python 3 remains (_[more information](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2116#issuecomment-955615529)_).
  - `yescrypt` is now supported upstream as a password hash algorithm, `docker-mailserver` continues to use `SHA512-CRYPT` (_[more information](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2116#issuecomment-955800544)_).
- **[chore]** Dovecot statistics service disabled [#2292](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2292)

## `v10.3.0`

**WARNING:** This release had a small regression affecting the detection of changes for certificates provisioned in `/etc/letsencrypt` with the config ENV `SSL_TYPE=letsencrypt`, unless you use Traefik's `acme.json`. If you rely on this functionality to restart Postfix and Dovecot when updating your cert files, this will not work and it is advised to upgrade to `v10.4.0` or newer prior to renewal of your certificates.

- **[fix]** The Dovecot `userdb` will now additionally create "dummy" accounts for basic alias maps (_alias maps to a single real account managed by Dovecot, relaying to external providers aren't affected_) when `ENABLE_QUOTAS=1` (default) as a workaround for Postfix `quota-status` plugin querying Dovecot with inbound mail for a user, which Postfix uses to reject mail if quota has been exceeded (_to avoid risk of blacklisting from spammers abusing backscatter_) [#2248](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2248)
  - **NOTE:** If using aliases that map to another alias or multiple addresses, _this remains a risk_.
- **[fix]** `setup email list` command will no longer attempt to query Dovecot quota status when `ENABLE_QUOTAS` is disabled [#2264](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2264)
- **[fix]** `SSL_DOMAIN` ENV should now work much more reliably [#2274](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2274), [#2278](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2278), [#2279](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2279)
- **[fix]** DKIM - Removed `refile:` (_regex type_) from KeyTable entry in `opendkim.conf`, fixes validation error output from `opendkim-testkey` [#2249](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2249)
- **[fix]** DMARC - Removed quotes around the hostname value in `opendmarc.conf`. This avoids an authentication failure where an OpenDKIM header was previously ignored [#2291](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2291)
- **[fix]** When using `ONE_DIR=1` (default), the `spool-postfix` folder now has the correct permissions carried over. This resolves some failures notably with sieve filters [#2273](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2273)
- **[improvement]** Warnings are now logged for ClamAV and SpamAssassin if they are enabled but Amavis is disabled (_which is required for them to work correctly_) [#2251](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2251)
- **[improvement]** `user-patches.sh` is now invoked via `bash` to assist Kubernetes deployments with `ConfigMap` [#2295](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2295)

### Internal

These changes are primarily internal and are only likely relevant to users that maintain their own modifications related to the changed files.

- **[chore]** Redundant config from Postfix `master.cf` has been removed, it should not affect any users as our images have not included any of the related processes [#2272](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2272)
- **[refactor]** `check-for-changes.sh` was carrying some duplicate code from `setup-stack.sh` that was falling out of sync, they now share common code [#2260](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2260)
- **[refactor]** `acme.json` extraction was refactored into a CLI utility and updated to Python 3 (_required for future upgrade to Debian 11 Bullseye base image_) [#2274](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2274)
- **[refactor]** As part of the Traefik `acme.json` and `SSL_DOMAIN` work, logic for `SSL_TYPE=letsencrypt` was also revised [#2278](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2278)
- **[improvement]** Some minor tweaks to how we derive the internal `HOSTNAME` and `DOMAINNAME` from user configured `hostname` and `domainname` settings [#2280](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2280)

## `v10.2.0`

- You no longer need to maintain a copy of `setup.sh` matching your version release from v10.2 of `docker-mailserver` onwards. Version specific functionality of `setup.sh` has moved into the container itself, while `setup.sh` remains as a convenient wrapper to: `docker exec -it <container name> setup <command>`.
- [`ONE_DIR`](https://docker-mailserver.github.io/docker-mailserver/v10.2/config/environment/#one_dir) now defaults to enabled (`1`).
- For anyone relying on internal location of certificates (_internal copy of mounted files at startup_), the Postfix and Dovecot location of `/etc/postfix/ssl` has changed to `/etc/dms/tls`. This may affect any third-party `user-patches.sh` scripts that depended on this path to update certs.
- The [_Let's Encrypt_ section of our SSL / TLS docs](https://docker-mailserver.github.io/docker-mailserver/v10.2/config/security/ssl#lets-encrypt-recommended) has been brought up to date.

### Bigger scripts-related improvements

- **[scripts]** update `setup.sh` to now use a running container first if one exists [#2134](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2134)
- **[scripts]** included `setup.sh` functionality inside the container to be version independent again [#2174](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2174)
- **[scripts]** `HOSTNAME` and `DOMAINNAME` setup improved [#2175](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2175)
- **[scripts]** `delmailuser` can now delete mailboxed without TLD [#2172](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2172)
- **[scripts]** properly exit on failure ([#2199](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2199) in conjunction with [#2196](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2196))
- **[scripts]** make `setup.sh` completely non-interactive for Podman users [#2201](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2201)

### Security

Some internal refactoring and fixes happened this release cycle in [#2196](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2196):

- **[improve]** The Postfix and Dovecot location of `/etc/postfix/ssl` has changed to `/etc/dms/tls`
- **[improve]** An invalid `SSL_TYPE` or a valid value with an invalid configuration will now panic, exiting the container and emitting a fatal error to the logs
- **[fix]** An unconfigured/empty `SSL_TYPE` ENV now correctly disables SSL support for Dovecot and general Postfix configurations. A reminder that this is unsupported officially, and is only intended for tests and troubleshooting. Use only [a valid `SSL_TYPE`](https://docker-mailserver.github.io/docker-mailserver/v10.2/config/environment/#ssl_type) (_`letsencrypt` and `manual` are recommended_) for production deployments
- **[fix]** `TLS_LEVEL=intermediate` now modifies the system (container) `openssl.cnf` config to set the minimum protocol to TLS 1.0 (_from 1.2_) and cipher-suite support to `DEFAULT@SECLEVEL=1` (_from `2`_). This change is required for Dovecot in upcoming Debian Bullseye upgrade, to be compatible with the `TLS_LEVEL=intermediate` cipher-suite profile. It may affect other software within the container that relies on this openssl config, should you extend the Docker image [#2193](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2193)
- **[fix]** Provide DH parameters (_default: RFC 7919 group `ffdhe406.pem`_) at build-time, instead of during startup. Custom DH parameters regardless of `ONE_DIR` are now only detected when mounted to `/tmp/docker-mailserver/dhparams.pem` [#2192](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2192)
- **[docs]** Revise the _Let's Encrypt_ section of our SSL / TLS docs [#2209](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2209)

### Miscellaneous small additions and changes

- **[ci]** improved caching [#2197](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2197)

## `v10.0.0`

This release improves on `9.1.0` in many aspect, including general fixes, Fail2Ban, LDAP and documentation. This release contains breaking changes.

- **[general]** Fixed many prose errors (spelling, grammar, indentation).
- **[general]** Documentation is better integrated into the development process and it's visibility within the project increased ([#1878](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1878)).
- **[general]** Added `stop_grace_period:` to example Compose file and supervisord ([#1896](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1896) [#1945](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1945))
- **[general]** `./setup.sh email list` was enhanced, now showing information neatly ([#1898](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1898))
- **[general]** Added update check and notification ([#1976](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1976), [#1951](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1951))
- **[general]** Moved environment variables to the documentation and improvements ([#1948](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1948), [#1947](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1947), [#1931](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1931))
- **[security]** Major Fail2Ban improvements (cleanup, update and breaking changes, see below)
- **[fix]** `./setup.sh email del ...` now works properly
- **[code]** Added color variables to `setup.sh` and improved the script as a whole ([#1879](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1879), [#1886](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1886))
- **[ldap]** Added `LDAP_QUERY_FILTER_SENDERS` ([#1902](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1902))

- **[docs]** PRs that contain changes to docs will now be commented with a preview link ([#1988](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1988))

### Breaking Changes

- **[security]** Fail2Ban adjustments:
  - Fail2ban v0.11.2 is now used ([#1965](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1965)).
  - The previous F2B config (from an old Debian release) has been replaced with the latest default config for F2B shipped by Debian 10.
  - The new default blocktype is now `DROP`, not `REJECT` ([#1914](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1914)).
  - A ban now applies to all ports (`iptables-allports`), not just the ones that were "attacked" ([#1914](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1914)).
  - Fail2ban 0.11 is totally compatible to 0.10, but the database got some new tables and fields (auto-converted during the first start), so once updated to DMS 10.0.0, you have to remove the database `mailstate:/lib-fail2ban/fail2ban.sqlite3` if you would need to downgrade to DMS 9.1.0 for some reason.
- **[ldap]** Removed `SASLAUTHD_LDAP_SSL`. Instead provide a protocol in `SASLAUTHD_LDAP_SERVER` and adjust `SASLAUTHD_LDAP_` default values ([#1989](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1989)).
- **[general]** Removed `stable` release tag ([#1975](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1975)):
  - Scheduled builds are now based off `edge`.
  - Instead of `stable`, please use the latest version tag available (_or the `latest` tag_).
  - The `stable` image tag will be removed from DockerHub in the near future.
- **[setup]** Removed `./setup config ssl` command (_deprecated since v9_). `SSL_TYPE=self-signed` remains supported however. ([`dc8f49de`](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/commit/dc8f49de548e2c2e2aa321841585153a99cd3858), [#2021](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2021))

## `v9.1.0`

This release marks the breakpoint where the wiki was transferred to a [reworked documentation](https://docker-mailserver.github.io/docker-mailserver/edge/)

- **[feat]** Introduce ENABLE_AMAVIS env ([#1866](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1866))
- **[docs]** Move wiki to gh-pages ([#1826](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1826)) - Special thanks to @polarathene 👨🏻‍💻
  - You can [edit the docs](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/tree/master/docs/content) now directly with your code changes
  - Documentation is now versioned related to docker image versions and viewable here: <https://docker-mailserver.github.io/docker-mailserver/edge/>

## `v9.0.1`

A small update on the notification function which was made more stable as well as minor fixes.

- **[fix]** `_notify` cannot fail anymore - non-zero returns lead to unintended behavior in the past when `DMS_DEBUG` was not set or `0`
- **[refactor]** `check-for-changes.sh` now uses `_notify`

## `v9.0.0`

- **[feat]** Support extra `user_attributes` in accounts configuration ([#1792](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1792))
- **[feat]** Add possibility to use a custom dkim selector ([#1811](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1811))
- **[feat]** TLS: Dual (aka hybrid) certificate support! (eg ECDSA certificate with an RSA fallback for broader compatibility) ([#1801](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1801)).
  - This feature is presently only for `SSL_TYPE=manual`, all you need to do is provide your fallback certificate to the `SSL_ALT_CERT_PATH` and `SSL_ALT_KEY_PATH` ENV vars, just like your primary certificate would be setup for manual mode.
- **[security]** TLS: You can now use ECDSA certificates! ([#1802](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1802))
  - Warning: ECDSA may not be supported by legacy systems (most pre-2014). You can provide an RSA certificate as a fallback.
- **[fix]** TLS: For some docker-compose setups when restarting the docker-mailserver container, internal config state may have been persisted despite making changes that should reconfigure TLS (eg changing `SSL_TYPE` or replacing the certificate file) ([#1801](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1801)).
- **[refactor]** Split `start-mailserver.sh` ([#1820](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1820))
- **[fix]** Linting now uses local path to remove the sudo dependency ([#1831](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1831)).

### Breaking Changes

- **[security]** TLS: `TLS_LEVEL=modern` has changed the server-side preference order to 128-bit before 256-bit encryption ([#1802](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1802)).
  - NOTE: This is still very secure but may result in misleading lower scores/grades from security audit websites.
- **[security]** TLS: `TLS_LEVEL=modern` removed support for AES-CBC cipher suites and follows best practices by supporting only AEAD cipher suites ([#1802](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1802)).
  - NOTE: As TLS 1.2 is the minimum required for modern already, AEAD cipher suites should already be supported and preferred.
- **[security]** TLS: `TLS_LEVEL=intermediate` has removed support for cipher suites using RSA for key exchange (only available with an RSA certificate) ([#1802](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1802)).
